## Getting started
    
The python algorithm is derived from oxford java step counter algorithm. Please read the references available on site 'https://oxford-step-counter.github.io/'

Step detection algorithm consist of five steps:

* Pre-processing stage
* Filtering stage
* Scoring stage
* Detection stage
* Post-processing stage
    
For each stage a separate function is defined. As stated in the reference file the optimal set of parameters are used for the step detection.
