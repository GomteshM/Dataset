# DataSet and Python Implementation of the Oxford Step Counter 
<short description>
Data set used to tune the algorithm and validate it.


## Content

* `optimisation` contains the data used to optimised the parameters of the algorithm
* `validation` contains the traces used to validate the algorithm as implemented in the app
* `python-step-counter` contains the python file used to validate the algorithm
    PYTHON IMPLEMENTATION OF STEP COUNTER ALGORITHM
    Algorithm based on oxford java step counter
    (https://github.com/Oxford-step-counter/Java-Step-Counter)
    Modifications:
        Added plotting to compare steps data available in csv file and detected steps data
    sample output of program is present at the end of python file as comments.
